# Piano Tiles 
## by Arcadia Youlten, Felipe Perez, Amir Azzam, Sonia Leal, and Nicole Leser
>Second year Object Oriented Programming and Design final project 


## How to run the code:
>We use java SDK 13
>
>The project must be downloaded and unzipped to be executed, as it is too large to be directly uploaded to github.
>
>It is primarily coded in Java
>
>In order to excute the code you need to run the server first, as the client needs to connect to it.  
 

### Running the Server
>To run the server you need to select the main in the server package and run it.

### Running the Client
>After the server is up and running you can run the client. To disconnect the client from the server you only 
>need to close the JFrame, and the server will detect that and disconnect the client. 
>Running the client is similar to how you run the server, just go to the client package and run the main in there.

### Misc Info 
>if you run the database some default staticstics already exist, so the graphs will have some values in them.

>We made a user that is called "user" and has the password "user", we had to do it in the database as the password doesn't
>match the MIT Password Policy.

>To create a new user, once you enter the Client view you can click on the "Register" button, and then introduce all the needed credentials.
